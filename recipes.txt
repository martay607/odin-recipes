        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Fennel Seeds</li>

        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 Tbsp parsley, basil, 1 tsp salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about an hour and a half, stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8-10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure foil does not touch cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let rest 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
